# Food and Agriculture Data of Africa - Data Analysis

The project deals with performing the initial analysis of the food and agriculture data of Africa which contains different datasets of the crops for analysis in the country. 
The analysis of food and agriculture data of Africa is done on the crop production dataset and crop processing dataset which has the details about the crops that are produced and are processing each year in Africa. 
This analysis is helpful in determining the crop production that takes place every year in Africa based on the region where the subset analysis of the data is performed.
